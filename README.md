# Flow2Week2

## 03.03.2020 - Tuesday
In the "Callbacks and more" exercise I did number 1, 2, 4, and 5. Number 6 and 7 we did together in class, therefore it is also not in the project.

## 04.03.2020 - Wednesday
The "Fetch and Promises" exercises can be found in three different projects. 
- 1-3 is found in 'SPAExerciseDay3/code_simple_SPA'
- 4 is found in 'code_jsonserver_with_errors'
- The part of the exercise that says 'Create a Single Page Application that uses our cool API :-)' can be found in 'code_simple_SPA'. Note that it is DIFFERENT than the 'SPAExerciseDay3/code_simple_SPA'.

## 05.03.2020 - Thursday
I didn't do the "CORS and Single Page Application (SPA)" exercise.

## 06.03.2020 - Friday
The "Exam preparation exercise about AJAX, CORS and SVG" can be found under this days folder.
This "Frontend exercise (last part of exercise from last week (skip the red part)" exercise was a part 2 to the exercise from last week called "RESET_Persons_DTO".
